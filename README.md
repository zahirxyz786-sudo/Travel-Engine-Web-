# Travel-Engine-Web-
This repository holds a basic Travel Search Engine concept, implemented entirely within a single HTML file. It uses fundamental HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript to simulate input fields for destinations/dates and display dummy search results. It serves as a simple, client-side front-end template for travel booking platforms.
